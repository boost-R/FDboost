\item{riskFun}{only exists in \code{applyFolds}; allows to compute other risk functions than the risk 
of the family that was specified in object. 
Must be specified as function of arguments \code{(y, f, w = 1)}, where \code{y} is the

R package \code{parallel}, see \code{\link[mboost]{cvrisk}} for details.}

\value{
\code{cvMa} and \code{cvLong} return a matrix of sampling weights to be used in \code{cvrisk}. 

The functions \code{applyFolds} and \code{cvrisk.FDboost} return a \code{cvrisk}-object, 
which is a matrix of the computed out-of-bag risk. The matrix has the folds in rows and the 
number of boosting iteratins in columns. Furhtermore, the matrix has attributes including: 
\item{risk}{name of the applied risk function}
\item{call}{model call of the model object}
\item{mstop}{gird of stopping iterations that is used}
\item{type}{name for the type of folds}
}
\description{
Cross-validation and bootstrapping over curves to compute the empirical risk for 
hyper-parameter selection.

\details{
The number of boosting iterations is an important hyper-parameter of boosting.   
It be chosen using the functions \code{applyFolds} or \code{cvrisk.FDboost}. Those functions 
compute honest, i.e., out-of-bag, estimates of the empirical risk for different 
numbers of boosting iterations. 
The weights (zero weights correspond to test cases) are defined via the folds matrix, 
see \code{\link[mboost]{cvrisk}} in package mboost. 

In case of functional response, we recommend to use \code{applyFolds}. 
It recomputes the model in each fold using \code{FDboost}. Thus, all parameters are recomputed, 
including the smooth offset (if present) and the identifiability constraints (if present, only 
relevant for \code{bolsc}, \code{brandomc} and \code{bbsc}).  
Note, that the function \code{applyFolds} expects folds that give weights
per curve without considering integration weights.  

The function \code{cvrisk.FDboost} is a wrapper for \code{\link[mboost]{cvrisk}} in package mboost. 
It overrides the default for the folds, so that the folds are sampled on the level of curves 
(not on the level of single observations, which does not make sense for functional response).  
Note that the smooth offset and the computation of the identifiability constraints
are not part of the refitting if \code{cvrisk} is used. 
Per default the integration weights of the model fit are used to compute the prediction errors 
(as the integration weights are part of the default folds). 
Note that in \code{cvrisk} the weights are rescaled to sum up to one. 

The functions \code{cvMa} and \code{cvLong} can be used to build an appropriate 
weight matrix for functional response to be used with \code{cvrisk} as sampling 
is done on the level of curves. The probability for each 
curve to enter a fold is equal over all curves.     
The function \code{cvMa} takes the dimensions of the response matrix as input argument and thus
can only be used for regularly observed response. 
The function \code{cvLong} takes the id variable and the weights as arguments and thus can be used
for responses in long format that are potentially observed irregularly. 
 
If \code{strata} is defined 
sampling is performed in each stratum separately thus preserving 
the distribution of the \code{strata} variable in each fold.
}
\note{
Use argument \code{mc.cores = 1L} to set the numbers of cores that is used in 
parallel computation. On Windows only 1 core is possible, \code{mc.cores = 1}, which is the default.
